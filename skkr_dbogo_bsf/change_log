## Change log for the bogo skkr for including cpa

# Questions:
  rsp-scf/tmatini.f
     call tmat for species A and B, then 
     tminv = tminva --> comment? Call tata? 
  rsp-scf/locquant.f
      The wafu and gf can be stored in the same variable?
      What is rhova?
  rsp-scf/dens.f
      what happend with the different densities? 
      Is the spin and magnetisation density in the code? 
      what is zrhoeh?
